			<h1 class="bold">Hi First Name</h1>
			<p>We understand you have recently completed the variation from Lombard to Skye. There’s been a slight issue with your new Skye account.</p>
			<spacer size="16"></spacer>

			<p class="bold">What’s happened?</p>

			<p>The appropriate long term finance plans and/or transactions that were on on your Lombard account have not been posted to your Skye account as of yet. Below summarises your key account details:</p>
			<p>
			• It will show your correct credit limit<br>
			• It will show your correct available credit<br>
			• Transactions completed on your Skye Mastercard will appear on your account<br></p>
			<spacer size="16"></spacer>
			<p>We are rectifying this issue and this should be solved within the next few days.</p>
			<spacer size="16"></spacer>
			<p class="bold">The good news</p>
			<p>As a result of us not posting the appropriate transactions you will have no payment due this month. We also stopped charging any applicable interest on your account the day you accepted the migration therefore you will have no additional interest to pay.</p>
			<spacer size="16"></spacer>	
			<p>	We do apologise for any inconvenience caused and hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
