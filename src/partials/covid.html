                 As outlined on the call when we booked your appointment, we need to follow strict rules around clinic
                 visits
                 as
                 a
                 consequence of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

                 To ensure both your safety and wellbeing and that of our team members, weâ€™d remind you if you feel
                 unwell
                 or
                 have flu
                 like symptoms prior to your appointment, that you call us to reschedule to a later date.

                 We also need to comply to Social Distancing laws which only permit one person in the clinic at a time.
                 Please
                 note, if
                 you have someone accompanying you, they will need to wait outside the clinic during your appointment.
